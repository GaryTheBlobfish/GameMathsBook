Book On Game Mathematics

  - I apologise for the state of some of the diagrams, they looked fine in Notepad++
    but they do not look right in Github because of the fact that Github uses 2 spaces
    per tab indentation and Notepad++ does 4 per tab. This also means normal Notepad
    will display them wrong as it uses 8 space per tab indentation.
  - This book (will/already) covers:
      - Vectors
      - Sine/Cosine
      - Matrix Multiplication
      - Angles
      - Dot Product
      - Cross Product
