	ESSENTIAL MATHEMATICS CHAPTER 1:	PYTHAGORAS' THEOREM
	
		- Pythagoras' Theorem is a mathematical theorem that works with right
		  angle triangles. 

		BASICS:
		
			- With a right angle triangle, we can find the length of the longest
			  side by adding the 2 other sides squared and then square rooting 
			  the result.
			  
			  DIAGRAM:
			  
							h       /	|
								/		|
							/			|
						/				|	o
					/	)				|
				   ----------------------
							a
							
				- To find the length h, we add o^2 and a^2. We then square root 
				  the result and we have length h.
				  
				- So, for example, let's say o is 3 and a is 4:
				
					3^2 = 9
					4^2 = 16
					
					9 + 16 = 25
					
					square root of 25 is 5 and so the length of side h is 5.
					
				- Now the reasons for the sides being h, o and a are:
				
					h - the hypoteneuse, is the longest side and is not connected
						to the 90 degree angle
					
					o - because it is opposite to the angle (marked by the ) in 
						the diagram)
						
					a - because it is adjacent (next to) the angle.
		
		WHERE THIS IS USED:
		
			- One example is, if we were working on a 2D game, and the screen is
			  represented as a per x and y axis (where x is across and y is up).
			  Let's say we wanted to measure the distance between 2 points on the
			  screen, say the player is at (Px, Py) and to the right and up, the 
			  enemy is at (Ex, Ey), we can find out the distance on the Y axis by 
			  subtracting Py from Ey. We can also do the same for the other side,
			  The distance along the X axis would be Ex - Px.
			  So to find the distance, the following calculation would have to be
			  done:
			  
				distance = squareRoot((Ey - Py)^2 + (Ex - Px)^2)
			  
			  This can also be used if the enemy and the player were in swapped 
			  positions, the calculation of the distance on the Y and X axes would
			  have to be swapped around accordingly.
			  
			  These calculations can also be used in 3D, but instead of
			  
				c = squareRoot(a^2 + b^2)
			  
			  It would be
			  
				c = squareRoot(a^2 + b^2 + x^2)
